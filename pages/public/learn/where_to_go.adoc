Welcome to the pages of the J1-Template. If you are here the first time, a
good decision you get on that page first. For sure, there is no better place
to go. The crucial first step in finding your way to Jekyll is done.
Congratulations. The *Learn* section contains all you need to learn what
Jekyll and J1 can do for your website, for your new static web - if you like.

Roundtrip::
In this section, you’ll find a tour to show some of the main features of
the template system J1. This trip covers how image data can be managed using
J1, some background of the Template’s typography, discuss extensions, and
what J1 can do in general. The roundtrip is a visual tour, no technical stuff,
nothing academic. See what you will get as an overview of some of the top
features of J1.

If you like, continue by walking through the roundtrip examples by starting
the link:{url-j1-roundtrip--present-images}[tour here].

Rocketstart::
J1-Template is fully JAM-Stack ready. If you're interested in creating and
deploying an amazing J1 based site on the Internet in minutes without
installing any software locally on your PC, go for Netlify's One-Click-Deploy.
The tutorial link:{url-j1--rocketstart}[Rocketstart, {browser-window--new}] will take
about fifteen minutes and guides you through this easy 3-step-process.

J1 in a Day::
J1 in a Day is a tutorial learning to create modern websites using the J1
Template. This Tutorial focuses on the basics of Jekyll and J1, which all
people need to know for a successful way to a modern static website. Jekyll
(and J1) is quite different from classic Content Management Systems (CMS).

If you would like to learn more about the use of Jekyll and J1-Template, the
tutorials present what you need to know:

* The basics of modern static webs
* Creating an awesome Site
* Development System
* Project Management
* Create Content

It sounds much, spending a whole day to get Jekyll and J1 to know. Yes, it is
much. But it makes sense to get a full overview of what can be achieved by modern
static websites.

Go for link:{url-j1-web-in-a-day--meet-and-greet}[J1 in a Day, {browser-window--new}]!
